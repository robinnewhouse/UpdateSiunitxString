# UpdateSiunitxString
Working on my thesis and copying LaTeX from internal documentation source to thesis source.
The internal documentation didn't use the siunitx package, but I am, and find that I am updating strings by hand a lot.
I made this script as a way to convert the string quickly and to avoid mistyping the numerical value and unit.
